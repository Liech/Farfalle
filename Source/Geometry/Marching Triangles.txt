Marching Triangles isoline distance finding:
one full subdivision -> prohibits 3 Zero Triangles
search&mark for edges enclosing desired value
pick edge -> find if triangles have other marked edges -> travel along
  visited edge?->loop finished
  no edge left -> just streak (degenerated case)
all marked edges visted? no? ->pick one of the remaining edges and repeat
